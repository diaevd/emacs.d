;;; Commentary:

;; Put this file into your load-path and the following into your ~/.emacs:
;;   (require 'setup-lisp)

;;; Code:

(eval-when-compile
  (if (version< emacs-version "27.1")
      (require 'cl)
    (require 'cl-lib)))

(straight-use-package 'paredit)

(eval-after-load 'paredit
  ;; need a binding that works in the terminal
  '(define-key paredit-mode-map (kbd "M-)") 'paredit-forward-slurp-sexp))

;; (show-paren-mode 1)  ;; highlight matching parenthasis
(add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'paredit-mode)

;; nifty documentation at point for lisp files
(add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'turn-on-eldoc-mode)

  ;; Note that the built-in `describe-function' includes both functions
  ;; and macros. `helpful-function' is functions only, so we provide

  ;; Lookup the current symbol at point. C-c C-d is a common keybinding
  ;; for this in lisp modes.
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-d") #'helpful-at-point)

  ;; Look up *F*unctions (excludes macros).
  ;;
  ;; By default, C-h F is bound to `Info-goto-emacs-command-node'. Helpful
  ;; already links to the manual, if a function is referenced there.
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-h F") #'helpful-function)

  ;; Look up *C*ommands.
  ;;
  ;; By default, C-h C is bound to describe `describe-coding-system'. I
  ;; don't find this very useful, but it's frequently useful to only
  ;; look at interactive functions.
